This project is scaffolded with **Vite**, **React**, **TypeScript** and **TailwindCSS**. UI components are built with a minimal setup inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

## Development

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be generated in the `dist/` folder and is ready to be deployed on platforms like **Vercel**.

## Technologies

- Vite
- React + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
